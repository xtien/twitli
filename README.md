# Twitli

In 2008 I created Twitli, a Twitter client for Android. I put it in Google Play on the day it opened. 
Twitli had the usual functions for tweeting, liking, replying, etc, as well as
additional features like translation - it would translate tweets into any language you wished) - and
geo-tweeting - showing the tweeps in your timeline on a Google Maps page. I retired Twitli when Twitter
published their own app.

Recently, I created a new version of Twitli. It has only minimal Twitter functions like tweeting and liking,
but it has additional features:
- when your number of followers changes, Twitli shows a tweet about the year that is equal to your new number of followers
- when a tweet of 280 characters comes in, Twitli shows it in green
- when you tweet a number, Twitli takes it as a year and tweets what happened in that year
- a simple chatbot in Twitli allows it to autoreply to incoming tweets. 

The new Twitli is not available in Google Play yet. I will publish it as soon as basic chatbot functions work.
